# Neuroprostetics (University Course @TUM)
University course in Neuroprosthetics at Technical University Munich. From Fourier transforms and OED solvers, to simulations of the multicompartment Hodking-Huxley model to describe signal propergation in axons. Finished with a simple implementation of the sound coding in a hypothetical cochlea implant.
