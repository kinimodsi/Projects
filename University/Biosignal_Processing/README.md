# Project Course Biosignal Processing
In this university course, I analysed experimental EEG data. The goal was to detect Error-Related Potentials in the data to robustly classify errors during the execution of a task.

Check the PDF report to get a better idea of the experiment from which the data comes. "Tutorial_2_improved.m" contains the main code. Functions and the are found in the respective folders. In the Folder "Plots" you will find the plotting results of the script with more compute intense parameters (more CV iterations / number of weak classifiers / C-Values) than in the current script.
