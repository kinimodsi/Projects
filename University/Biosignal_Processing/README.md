# Project Course Biosignal Processing
In this university course, I analysed experimental EEG data. The goal was to detect Error-Related Potentials in the data to robustly classify errors during the execution of a task.

Check the PDF report to get a better idea of the experiment from which the data comes. The file *Tutorial_2_improved.m* contains the main code. The EEG data and used functions are located in their respective folders. In the *Plots* folder, you will find the plotting results of a version of the script, which uses more computationally expensive parameters (e.g., more CV iterations, a higher number of weak classifiers, and increased C-values) than the current script.

During the course's grading process, my resulting label vector was compared to the actual labels and achieved over 90% accuracy, the best result in my class.
